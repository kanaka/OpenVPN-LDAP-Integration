OpenVPN LDAP Integration README

This file only describes how to download, unpack and fix the accessory
files to enable the vpn_client program to create Windows installer
packages.

The README.DD-WRT file descript how to configure and create the DD-WRT
firmware images that contain an embedded VPN client and router.

See docs/config.html for how to setup your infrastructure to be able
to use these tools.

*** Prepare Windows client package data ***

    The program on Linux that creates the Windows installer is
    makensis (part of the nsis package). This program reads in
    a package definition file and then generates the installer based
    on that definition file.

    The actual files that are installed by the installer are made up
    of two parts: the openvpn program itself, and the openvpn GUI
    component that provides a task tray icon for easy connecting and
    disconnecting.
